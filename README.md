NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE THE APP PERMISSIONS OR IT WILL NOT WORK
You need to go into the settings and give the app READ/WRITE and Camera Permissions
Otherwise the PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK (It will just close)

Also you will need to add the program to the list of exepted apps from Battery saver
in the exempted apps. Otherwise the Battery saver will kill the program if it thinks it is
using to much battery power.

This is is still in early development so it is not great yet.
