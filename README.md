# AcidCam_Android

NOTE: YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE THE APP PERMISSIONS, OR IT WILL NOT WORK
You need to go into the settings and give the app READ/WRITE and Camera Permissions
Otherwise, the PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK (It will just close)

Also, you will need to add the program to the list of exempted apps from the Battery saver
in the exempted apps. Otherwise, the battery saver app will kill the program if it thinks it is
using to much battery power.

Also, it only works in Landscape mode; you may have to use the Flip X, Flip Y, or Flip X and Y
on your tablet because they are all different.

Most of these issues will hopefully be worked through as
the project is still in early development, so it is not perfect or 100% yet.
